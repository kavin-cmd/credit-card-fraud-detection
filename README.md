# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and resources for a credit card fraud detection system. The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can identify and flag potential instances of credit card fraud based on historical transaction data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess raw transaction data to prepare it for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a fraud detection model using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment:** Optionally, deploy the model for real-time fraud detection in a production environment.

## Getting Started
